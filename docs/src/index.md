# [CPD-TGW3D-8a](@ref LinearAlgebraicRepresentation.Lar_header)

`CPD-TGW3D-8a.jl` is a [Julia](http://julialang.org) library to perform topological gift arrangement on cellular complexes expressed through the [**Linear Algebraic Representation** (LAR)](./lar.html).
This library is developed by Scarano, Malvati, Di Lorenzo as a project for the Calcolo Parallelo e Distribuito exam.
